# Liver-Disease-Prediction-using-Boosting-Algorithms
Developed a machine learning model to predict Chronic Liver Disease (CLD) using seven boosting algorithms on two datasets (LDPD, ILPD). Applied data preprocessing, upsampling, and hyperparameter tuning. Evaluated models with k-fold cross-validation, achieving the best results with Gradient Boosting. Used two datasets, ILPD and LDPD, and applied the same boosting algorithms and preprocessing techniques, including upsampling and hyperparameter tuning, to both datasets for consistent model evaluation.
